# nft completion for zsh


This is an attempt to create zsh command completion for nft (the nftables user space utility). As I'm neither an expert in nft nor an expert in zsh, this simply works but may seem awful to experts of these domains. So please help me make this a better utility by making constructive criticism ;) .

Currently implemented subcommands: all commands listed in the man page, except the content of the add commands (eg. add rule, add set, add map, etcpp) and delete element. I'm currently working on add rule.
